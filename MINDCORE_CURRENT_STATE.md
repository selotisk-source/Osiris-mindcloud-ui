# MindCore / MindCloud — Current State
**Last reconciled:** 2026-10-11  
**Source of truth:** repository files and newly observed test/deployment results. This file must be updated after meaningful work.

## Verified from repository metadata in this session
- Repository exists: `selotisk-source/Osiris-mindcloud-ui`.
- Default branch: `main`.
- Connected GitHub integration reports push/admin access.
- `README.md` describes MindCore as owner of typed state, task graphs, capability routing, lifecycle, policy and verification; OSIRIS is a client/testbed.
- README documents an Arena skill and verification script: `skills/arena/SKILL.md`, `mindcore/arena-skill.js`, `scripts/verify-arena-skill.js`, and says it is part of `npm run verify`.
- README describes multiple supervised adapters and guarded promotion/approval behavior.

## Not verified in this update
- Whether current CI is green.
- Whether the public Railway deployment is healthy or reflects the current `main` commit.
- Whether the complete backend → adapter/runtime → persisted evidence/state → frontend flow passes end-to-end.
- Whether every README-listed adapter is configured and executes successfully in the current environment.
- Whether prior-reported Cognee ONLINE status still holds.

Do not silently convert these items into “working” status without fresh evidence.

## Session checkpoint — PAUSED
**Checkpoint date:** 2026-10-11
**Scope:** The Claude handover-document task is paused for later resumption. Engineering work on the existing MindCore/MindCloud runtime and adapter integration continues separately.
**Handover resume instruction:** Resume the document/Claude-project setup from this checkpoint without recreating the handover. For active engineering, follow the current milestone and next actions below.
**Last completed work in this handover session:** Added and read back `MINDCORE_MINDCLOUD_MASTER.md`, `MINDCORE_CURRENT_STATE.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` on `main`; linked them from `README.md`. No application tests or deployment verification were performed in this session.

## Adapter API failure/audit coverage — 2026-10-11
- Extended `scripts/verify-adapter-api-failure-audit.js` to exercise the same provider HTTP 503 failure path through two independently registered adapters: Graft (`build`) and OpenMontage (`plan`).
- The test now expects two provider calls, two audit entries, request IDs for both responses, and neither adapter promoted to verified after failed executions.
- Change commit: `b3435aee728049679e9cb404f7d42ffac830403e`.
- Previous commit `891b9f564f1eca71dedb79c36b23576a8dbce6dc`: MindCloud Runtime Verification passed; full MindCloud Verification including production smoke passed. New workflows for the two-adapter API test are queued and must be checked before treating this change as verified.

## Unified Build Loop progress — 2026-10-11

- User priority: complete the real MindCore/MindCloud loop; preserve the 2×2 four-station default.
- Fixed `index.html` Heritage Map routing: it no longer switches to two stations and targets hidden station 3; it preserves four stations and selects visible GEO / Heritage station 2. Added regression assertions in `scripts/verify-workspace-layout.js`.
- Bounded Overpass failover in `mindcloud/native-adapters.js`: one shared deadline across mirrors, 2.5-second per-attempt cap, 8-second health budget and 15-second execution budget. Added a stalled-upstream regression test in `scripts/verify-native-adapters.js`.
- `scripts/verify-production.js` now retries transient failures for required GET checks with endpoint-specific diagnostics. Optional Overpass health is probed once and reports an outage as a warning instead of retrying repeatedly.
- `main` has since gained deep E2E result caching with refreshed memory/browser health (`f6b7dc99`) and a test-runtime cache bypass (`ee508a85`). Those are concurrent main-branch changes; confirm deployment status before treating them as live.
- Evidence from production smoke on PR head `ddf6f4f6`: passed the required smoke checks, including Cognee write/readback and OSIRIS route. Overpass was explicitly reported offline; it was not marked healthy.
- CI on the next PR head initially failed because the persistence test assumed an explicit self-test always performs a second memory write. The test was updated to accept either a fresh run or the production cached-result contract while checking that cached health is refreshed. The newest commit and its CI still need verification.
- Railway at the last check: frontend online on commit `228feaab`; backend deployment for `ee508a85` was building; Cognee Memory, browser-use-runner and browser-chromium were online. Do not call the full deployment verified until that backend deployment and the latest production smoke finish.

## Current milestone
Establish and verify the real MindCore/MindCloud execution loop across backend and frontend, reusing the existing implementation.

## Next actions
1. Inspect repository tree, package scripts, current commits and CI status.
2. Run the repository’s prescribed verification command (`npm run verify`, after checking scripts and environment).
3. Identify the highest-impact failing or missing link in task intake → orchestration → adapter execution → evidence/state persistence → frontend display.
4. Fix the smallest reproducible issue and add/update a regression test.
5. Verify the result; check deployment separately from local/CI verification.
6. Update this file with exact evidence and the next remaining blocker.

## Reporting format
- **Changed:** exact files and purpose.
- **Verified:** checks actually run and results.
- **Not verified:** relevant gaps.
- **Blocker:** only a concrete obstacle.
- **Next action:** one executable step.
